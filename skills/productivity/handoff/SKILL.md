  a copy to claude-mem. Use when ending a work session or handing off to

# Handoff

Generate a complete, accurate handoff document by examining real project state — not from memory alone, not from guesses.

**Core principle:** Every claim in the handoff must be verifiable from `git`, files, or claude-mem. No hallucinated state.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session
will focus on and tailor the document accordingly.

---

## Phase 1 — Gather Real State

Run these in parallel:

```bash
# 1. Git state
git status
git log --oneline -15
git diff --stat HEAD~5..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff --stat

# 2. Uncommitted changes
git diff --name-only
git diff --cached --name-only

# 3. Current branch
git branch --show-current
```

Also check:
- Any `.claude/plans/` files for active plans
- Recent session context from claude-mem (`get_observations` for last 5–10 obs if available)
- Any open TODO comments in recently touched files (`rg "TODO|FIXME|HACK" --changed-files` if applicable)

---

## Phase 2 — Build the Handoff Document

Structure the document as follows. Skip any section where there's genuinely nothing to report — do not pad with placeholders.

```markdown
# Handoff — [Project Name] — [Date YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm]

## Branch
`[branch-name]`

## What Was Done
<!-- List completed work items with file paths and brief descriptions -->
- [Item 1]: `path/to/file.ts` — description
- [Item 2]: ...

## Current State
<!-- Honest description of what's working, what's partially done, what's broken -->
[Paragraph or bullets. No fluff.]

## Uncommitted Changes
<!-- List files with uncommitted changes and their status -->
- `path/to/file.ts` — [modified/new/deleted]: what changed

## Pending Work
<!-- What needs to be done next, in priority order -->
1. [Task 1] — [why it's next / dependency]
2. [Task 2]
...

## Blockers / Open Decisions
<!-- Decisions pending, questions unanswered, external dependencies -->
- [Blocker]: [what's needed to unblock]

## Context for Next Session
<!-- The non-obvious things that would trip up someone picking this up cold -->
- [Key context 1]
- [Key context 2]

## Quick Resume
<!-- One-liner or two to paste into the next session to get up to speed fast -->
> "We were working on [X]. Last thing done was [Y]. Next step is [Z]."

## Suggested Skills
<!-- Skills the next agent should invoke, and for what -->
- `/[skill]` — [why it applies to the pending work]
```

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (PRDs, plans, ADRs,
issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

## Phase 3 — Deliver to Clipboard

**Do not save a file** in the workspace or temp directory. **Copy the full handoff document to the OS clipboard** so the user can paste it into the next chat.

### Clipboard delivery

Pipe the finished document to the system clipboard in a single shell invocation:

| OS | Command |
|----|---------|
| macOS | `pbcopy` (e.g. `printf '%s' "$content" \| pbcopy` or `pbcopy < handoff.md`) |
| Linux (X11) | `xclip -selection clipboard` |
| Linux (Wayland) | `wl-copy` |
| Windows | `clip` |

Use a heredoc or temp file only if the shell needs it; **delete any temp file immediately after copying**. Never leave a handoff file behind in the workspace.

### Report to user

After copying, tell the user briefly — e.g. "Copied to clipboard — paste into your next chat with Cmd+V". Do **not** report a file path (there is none).

### Optional — save to memory

If the session had significant architectural decisions, decisions about approach, or non-obvious context, **offer** to save a project memory with the key facts via claude-mem. This is independent of the clipboard copy and only happens if the user accepts.

## Rules

- **Redact secrets:** Never include API keys, passwords, tokens, connection strings or personally identifiable information. Reference the env var name, not the value.
- **No hallucination:** If you don't know something, say "unknown — verify with git/code."
- **No padding:** Empty sections get removed, not filled with "N/A."
- **File paths must be real:** Every file path you list must have been seen in this session or verified via `git`.
- **Be specific:** "Updated the glucose wizard" is bad. "Added `horaActual()` to `glucosa.ts:45` and wired it into `RegistroGlucosaMovil`" is good.
- **Quick Resume must be copy-pasteable** as a conversation opener.
- **Clipboard, not file:** The handoff goes to the clipboard. Never write a handoff file into the workspace.
